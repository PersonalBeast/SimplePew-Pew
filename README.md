# Simple Pew-Pew Game


## Description

Simple Pew-Pew is a simple arcade-style game built with Python and the Pygame library. In this game, you control a red circle (the player) and your goal is to shoot down as many blue circles (enemies) as possible while avoiding collisions with them. The game keeps track of your score, and it's game over if an enemy collides with you.

## How to Play

- Use the W, A, S, D keys to move the player circle up, down, left, and right, respectively.
- Move your mouse to aim the player's shooting direction.
- Click the left or right mouse button to shoot green circles (bullets) towards the enemies.
- The enemies will spawn randomly on the screen and move towards you.
- Score points by shooting down enemies. Each successful hit increases your score.
- Avoid colliding with enemies, as it will end the game.
